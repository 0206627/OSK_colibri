# OSK Colibri

This is a working example for an app that does the following:
- Receives a NOOP command and adds 2 to a counter 
- Receives a RESET command and resets the counter
- Receives a NEW_CMD command and logs text depending on the given number

NOTE: Last function is yet to be implemented in cosmos
