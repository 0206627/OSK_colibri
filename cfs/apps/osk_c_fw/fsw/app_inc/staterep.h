/*
** Purpose:  Define a class that provides a mechanism for objects to report 
**           boolean states represented by a single bit that are aggregated
**           into an app state report packet.
**
** Notes:
**   1. This code was originally acquired from the NASA cFS External Code
**      Interface (ECI) NOSA release and that was named FaultRep because it
**      was exicitly used to report faults using one bit for each fault
**      which made it very easy to configure Limit Checker to logically
**      combine faults. For OSK it was generalized to be a boolean state
**      reporter and it remains functionally very similar.
**   2. This code must be reentrant and no global data can be used. 
**   3. STATEREP_Constructor() must be called prior to any other STATEREP_ 
**      functions
**   4. The telemetry generation requires that an even number of state
**      16-bit state words be defined.
**   5. This object does not associate any meaning to the state bit IDs.
**   6. Typically multiple state definition points are "ORed" together to
**      an meta-state especially when states represents faults. For example,
**      if fault A or fault B occur then take corrective action X. This
**      utility assumes the combining of state definition points is 
**      performed by the received of this utility's telemetry packet.
**   7. The ReportMode flag has the following definitions
**      - STATEREP_NEW_REPORT - The ID notifications for an app's current
**        execution cycle are copied into the message.
**      - STATEREP_MERGE_REPORT - The ID notifications for an app's current
**        execution cycle are merged(logically ORed) with the message
**   8. STATEREP_BIT_ID_MAX must be defined prior to including this header.
