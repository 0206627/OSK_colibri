# SimpleSat (SimSat) Mission Sim Pass
#
# Perform operational functions during a simulated ground contact.  This script
# is designed to make you think about what types of functions need to be
# performed. It is not trying to be prescriptive in how to perform them. Each
# mission has its own unique ops concept and functional requirements. These
# will drive strategies data collection priorities, level of automation, 
# assesment vs corrective action during a contact (health & safety), etc. 
#
# Notes:
#   1. This script is part of the cFS systems engineering training module
#   2. OSK uses TFTP and not CFDP for file transfers which impacts how
#      files are transferred and managed onboard.
#
# Global Script Variables:
#   simsat_ops_enable - Boolean indicating whether ops example is active
#   simsat_ops_status - Text string displayed on ops example screen
